This was my first assignment at Hive, a coding school part of the 42 school network.

The goal here was to start writing our own library of useful functions. 
As the school goes on, we're allowed to update more functions in to this "libft" libraray. 
This one here is the first stage of my library.

I also included my  main.c, a file with some very basic main functions to test my functions (although as we pushed to Vogsphere, no additional or unused functions were allowed.)
