This was my first assignment at Hive, a coding school part of the 42 school network.

The goal here was to start writing our own library of useful functions. 
As the school goes on, we're allowed to update the library by adding more functions. 
This version is the first stage of my Libft without further functions.

I also included main.c, a file with some very basic low level tests for my functions (although as we pushed to Vogsphere, no additional or unused functions were allowed.)
